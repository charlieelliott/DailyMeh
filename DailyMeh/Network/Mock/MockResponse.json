         "title":"Treat Your Feet",
         "body":"Maybe you work a job where you're on your feet all day. Or, maybe you have some ailment, and a real-deal medical professional has told you that you should probably invest in something to soothe your aching arches and the like. Or maybe you're training for a marathon.\r\n\r\nIf any of these things are true, then you should buy this thing. Obviously.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: maybe it's not a marathon you're training for, but rather you're doing the couch to 5k program. Or hell, maybe you're just trying to get more steps in. Or maybe you're not even doing that! Maybe you spend much of your day trapped behind a desk and much of your night on the couch, moving from professionally sedentary to casually sedentary day after day.\r\n\r\nStill, you should buy this thing. Obviously. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because who friggin' cares? That's why.\r\n\r\nSure, maybe if this thing was $400, you'd want to do some real thinking about whether or not this is something you truly need. You'd want to consider how often you'd use it, how much satisfaction you'd get out of it, and where, if anywhere, that money could be put to better use. \r\n\r\nBut we're selling this thing about ten times less than that. \r\n\r\nThat means, you can easily justify this purchase, whether your feet could use a warm water bath with massaging rollers and aromatherapy because you're so incredibly active or because you'd simply enjoy giving your feet a warm water bath with massaging rollers and aromatherapy.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, if you're like, *Even about $40 is too much to spend on something just to feel a little luxurious,* that's fair. But remember: We're barely past the mid-point of December. The winter is young and you've been buoyed by the joy and frantic energy of the holidays. It will only get worse from here. \r\n\r\nSo buy one now, and then thank us for the comfort come the gray days of January and February."
